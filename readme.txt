This is a Flashlike framework built in javascript. Clearly the way in which Flash outlines content is fairly well done, however it's requirement of a plugin is fairly outdated. The aim of this project is to combine the html5 core concepts and the organization of items that Flash uses.

The project should contain:
Scenes (much like pages)
Content (much like symbols in flash, image, text etc.)
Actions (libraries of code that act on content and scenes)
Event Handlers
